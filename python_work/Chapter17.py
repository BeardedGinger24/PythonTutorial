Using a Web API

A web API is a part of a website designed to interact with programs that
use very specific URLs to request certain information. This kind of request
is called an API call. The requested data will be returned in an easily processed
format, such as JSON or CSV. Most apps that rely on external data
sources, such as apps that integrate with social media sites, rely on API calls.
